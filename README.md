# Data science in finance

In this repo, I will be using APIs to extract equity data for analysis, visualization, and forecasting.

The metricFxns and vizFxns scripts store useful functions that I pull from in my notebooks to reduce lines of code.

The machine learning and visualization notebooks are described appropriately based on their contents.

I will add a more meaningful write-up and conclusion once this reaches a more stable state.
